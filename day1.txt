1. class variables acn be accessed inside the method using th keyword self.
2.instance variables can be accessed inside the class using object_name.variable_name
3.Variables inside methods are having local scope . We cannot access them outside the class.

                                                         ^^^^^^DATA STUCTURES:^^^^^^^^^
In order to structurise the data ,to keep it efficient in trems of memory usage extracting information is called data structures .
                                                DATA STURUCTERS:
 LINEAR:                                                                                                    NON-LINEAR:
 static:array                                                                                                graph
 dynamic:list,stack,queue                                                                       tree

LINKED LIST:
List  of data or items linked with one another is called llist.Eg:Spotify

Single Linked list operations:
1.Insertion:
	#inserting at the beginning 
	#inserting at a position
	#inserting at the end
